			<h2>About <span>Me</span></h2>
 			<p> I am a skilled and passionate technology professional with a diverse background in various tech disciplines, ranging from databases and cloud technologies to programming and mentoring. 
             I am proficient in NoSQL databases such as DynamoDB, Cassandra (AWS Keyspaces), and MongoDB. I am currently working on specializing within Amazon Services for Machine learning (SagMaker, Amazon Bedrock) and have interest in Retrieval Augmented Generative applications.
             In addition, I have studied the fundamentals of blockchain technology and I am constantly upskilling in Smart Contract Auditing via portals such as [Cyfrin Updraft](https://www.cyfrin.io/updraft) and honed my ability to troubleshoot any Python related issue be it within an Cloud Service or just algorithms within the language. 
	     I have deployed Python-Flask applications to Cloud environments or platforms like Heroku and AWS Elastic Beanstalk. 
	With strong Python programming skills, I have automated tasks such as creating stored procedures for a previous employer (BITanium) also built scripts for interacting with RDBMS sources. 
	     I have worked with running scripts within IoT devices such as a RasperyPi and I still have interests in how to shrink machine learning models to work within such devices.
 As a mentor and trainer, I believe I have played a pivotal role in improving the skills of AWS engineers within the team (mainly within the NoSQL and Machine learning profile in Cape Town). 
		I am constantly aiming to lend a hand to a fellow engineer and this is where I get to assess my own understanding of concepts, teaching and improving on my own skills as knowledge sharing is the best way to see your impact.
